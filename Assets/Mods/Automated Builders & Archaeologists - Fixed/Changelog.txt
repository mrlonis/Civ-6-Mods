Update 3 May, 2019 (eudaimonia)

- Updated for Game Version: 1.0.0.317 (416354).
- UI: Adjust the size and position to fit the vanilla UI.


Update 8 Jul, 2018

General Fixes and Changes
- Enforce sea/land domain rule for improvements. This fixes issues with improving resources that have both land and sea improvements (such as Amber).
- Updated selection algorithm to address undesired action switching.
- Enforce new improvement rules added by Rise and Fall expansion.
- Indonesia Kampung (and any modded improvements with same requirements): Properly check if the plot is next to a sea resource as required.
- Fishery, City Park: Properly check if the city has an established governer with Aquaculture, Parks and Recreation promotion.
- Enforce a maximum number of unique improvements of a certain type per city/empire to reduce possible unique improvement spam. Changeable in the mod settings (default of 3 unique improvements of one type per city).
- You can also override the maximums for specific unique improvements. By default, Colossal Head unique improvement caps are reduced at 1 per city and 10 per empire.
- Fixed script definitions for traders/civilian/religious units so that new units of that type added by mods or DLC will be recognized.
- Trimmed debug messages to lua.log, for more readability and because some users' logs were getting too long to post using pastebin.

UI
- Removed UnitPanel.lua replacement, added a separate panel to automate units and also show their current status.
- This new method makes the ability to automate units more reliable. It also means this mod is now compatible with other mods that replace the UnitPanel.lua file.
- Added a Settings Menu that you can use to change the settings while in game. Check out the mod discussion for more information.



Update Jan 17, 2018
- Fixed an issue where automated units would try to target plots in National Parks. I forgot about them!


Update Jan 13, 2018
- Fixed a bug where the mod would only ever recognize one leader/civilization with a unique improvement. This would have caused issues 
	if you were playing with a mod that gives a trait for a unique improvement to multiple default/modded leaders.
- Fixed a "ghost unit" issue where newly created units had a small chance of becoming automated right away and bugging out, 
	taking on the automation from a previously destroyed/spent unit if the game assigned them the old unit's ID.
- Tried to fix an issue where there was a small chance a Builder could target a plot outside of player's borders. 
- Implemented a basic virtual moderator for the automated units: if a unit tries to do something and there is an error, 
	that action on that plot will be banned for all automated units for that session (the data is reset when the UI is refreshed 
	or when you re-load the game). Please post a bug report if you ever see a unit doing something bad like moving back and forth for several turns.
- Changed how required techs/civics were checked so that if a modder ever makes both a Tech AND Civic required for an 
	improvement that the mod will check for both.


Update Jan 6, 2018
- Updated actual automation code for compatibility with games without the Fall 2017 patch: If the Fall 2017 patch is not installed,
	Automated units will no longer try to target plots that have religious units since they did not have their own layer until this patch.
- Enemy spies should no longer block Automated units targeting the plot. This didn't really affect automated Builders or Archaeologists 
	since they never targeted plots with districts anyways, but it will be important for future mods with other automated units.


Update Jan 5, 2018
- Second attempt to fix incompatibility with UnitPanel.lua from before the Fall 2017 Patch.
	The mod should work with games without the patch now.


Update Jan 3, 2018
- Attempted to fix incompatibility with UnitPanel.lua from before the Fall 2017 Patch.


Update: Dec 29, 2017
- Finding Builder actions was previously set up so that Builders would only repair stuff 
	within 3 tiles of your cities (or strategic/luxury resources anywhere). Fixed so that after 
	they are done doing everything within 3 tiles of your cities (or improving/repairing 
	strategic/luxury anywhere), Builders will check all of your tiles for possible repairs 
	if you have roads or have manually built improvements out there.
- Builders were removing jungle/woods for the Resourceful Mod resources improved by Lumbermills 
	when it was not necessary to remove the feature to improve the resource. Fixed so that Builders 
	will just build the Lumbermill over the resource + feature without removing the feature first.

Archaeologists
- Fixed the setting for archaeologists not knowing where all artifacts are. Before, if you 
	changed the setting to false they would only check in "visible" tiles for the player, 
	now it should check all "revealed" tiles for the player on the map.
- The previous version was set up so that Archaeologists would never target the same plot. 
	This could mean that in multiplayer games, archaeologists from different players would not go for the same plot. 
	Changed code so that archaeologists from different players can target the same plot, seeing which one gets there first.
- Archaeologists have a new setting that allows you to turn off automated Archaeologists 
	excavating in other player's territory. 
By default it is turned off so that archaeologists won't excavate in other player's territory 
	and get messed up trying to navigate through other players' units.

Builders
- For automated Builder settings, I've updated how they work so that if a line is 
	deleted entirely from the settings then the Builder will never perform that action.
- Once automated Builders have finished building improvements within 3 tiles 
	of your cities (or strategic or luxury resources anywhere in your borders), 
	you can turn on a setting to have them build farms within 4 tiles of your cites 
	on plots adjacent to farms within 3 tiles of your cities for the food adjacency bonus. 
	This feature must be turned on in settings (see discussion).
