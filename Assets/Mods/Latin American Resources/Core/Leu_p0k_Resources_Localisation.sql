		'The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern Peru and orthwest Boliva, between 8000 and 5000 BCE. Today, potatoes have a global distribution and are a staple crop in countless countries. In the Altiplano, potatoes were the principal energy source for the Inca civilization and its predecessors. Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom. However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the Great Irish Famine. Thousands of varieties still persist in the Andes, however, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household.'),

		'The capybara is the largest living rodent in the world. Capybaras graize on grasses and aquatic plants, and inhabit savannas and dense forests in South America. These herbivores are gregious animals, commonly living in groups of 10-20 individuals, which may balloon to include 100 individuals during the dry season as they gather around water sources. They have adapted well to urbanization in South America; they are docile and can be easily pet or hand-fed by humans, but physical contact is not advised, as their ticks are vectors for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.'),

		('LOC_RESOURCE_LEU_P0K_COCA_NAME',

		('LOC_PEDIA_RESOURCES_PAGE_RESOURCE_LEU_P0K_COCA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1',
		'Extensive archaeological evidence for the chewing of coca leaves dates back at least to the 6th century Moche period, and the subsequent Inca period, based on mummies found with a supply of coca leaves, pottery depicting the characteristic cheek bulge of a coca chewer, spatulas for extracting alkali and figured bags for coca leaves and lime made from precious metals, and gold representations of coca in special gardens of the Inca in Cuzco. Coca chewing may originally have been limited to the eastern Andes before its introduction to the Inca. As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a state monopoly and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the Topa Inca (late 15th century). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. Coca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. Paolo Mantegazza praising its stimulating effects on cognition.'),

		'The importance of llamas to the Incans cannot be overstated: their domestication was crucial for the creation and sustainment of their empire. Llamas were a source of food and wool, and, most importantly, were the only available beast of burden in the Andes. The Incans also sacrificed them in massive numbers to appease their gods, and they were buried in human graves. The deity Urcuchillay was depicted as a multicolored llama, and in Aymara mythology, llamas represent important beings.'),

		'Quinoa was first domesticated by Andean peoples around 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. It has been an important staple in the Andean cultures, where the plant is indigenous, but relatively obscure to the rest of the world. The Incas, who held the crop to be sacred, referred to it as chisoya mama or "mother of all grains", and it was the Inca emperor who would traditionally sow the first seeds of the season using "golden implements." Native Mapuches in south-central Chile cultivated quinoa, but there is uncertainty as to whether this variety originated in Central Chile or in the Central Andes of Peru and Bolivia.'),

		'Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in modern-day Paraguay, yerba mate was consumed by the Guaraní people for medicinal purposes. Remnants of yerba mate have also been found in a Quechua tomb near Lima, Peru and has therefore been suggested to have been associated with prestige.  It is not clear exactly when Spaniards began to drink mate but it is known by late 16th century to be widely consumed. Mate became such a popular beverage that Spanish settlers were said to have sold their clothing, weapons, and horses to purchase yerba mate. Today, mate remains a popular beverage in central and southern regions of South America, and is popular in the Druze communities of Syria and Lebanon, where it is imported from Argentina. Yerba mate has been claimed to have various benefical health effects, attributed to the high quantity of polyphenols found in the tea. It also contains compounds that may increase focus or energy and improve mood.');
