1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,100
From the malestrom of sand, wind, and fire our people emerge.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,100
And arrive here.  A new world, one ripe with great possibility...

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,200
And even greater dangers.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,100
Here our people stand, their destinies unwritten.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,500
Will they push forward into greatness...

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,300
Or see themselves lost to the ages?

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,100
Their fate lies in your hands.
